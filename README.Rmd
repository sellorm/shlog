You write shell scripts, right?

And you're always knocking together some sort of rough logging solution for each script.

We know, because we were exactly the same! And that's why we created `shlog`, an easy to use,
small, fast tool for printing consistent log messages directly to the terminal from your script.

Opinionated by design, `shlog` has the bare minimum of options to ensure you're productive with it right from the outset.


## Installing shlog

### Version 0.0.1:

* [Ubuntu 20.04](https://github.com/sellorm/shlog/releases/download/v0.0.1/shlog_0.0.1-3_ubuntu2004_amd64.deb)
* [Ubuntu 18.04](https://github.com/sellorm/shlog/releases/download/v0.0.1/shlog_0.0.1-3_ubuntu1804_amd64.deb)

## Using shlog

The `shlog` command requires two arguments. A loglevel for the given message and the mesaage itself;

```{bash}
./shlog info "This is an information message!"
```

The available loglevels are (in highest priority first order):

* FATAL
* ERROR
* WARN
* INFO
* DEBUG
* TRACE

These can be specified in either upper or lower case.

```{bash}
./shlog ERROR "This is an error message"
```

By default the loglevel is set to INFO.

* FATAL
* ERROR
* WARN
* INFO  <--
* DEBUG
* TRACE

This means that you will only see messages that have a priority of INFO or higher.

So, by default, the following command will not print anything:

```{bash}
./shlog DEBUG "This is a debug message"
```


You change the loglevel by setting the `LOGLEVEL` environment variable either in your script or the parent environment.

So the following will print:

```{bash}
export LOGLEVEL=DEBUG
./shlog DEBUG "This is a debug message"
```

This is because we used the environment variable to tell `shlog` the lowest type of log message we would like to see.

* FATAL
* ERROR
* WARN
* INFO
* DEBUG  <--
* TRACE

`shlog` also supports two special environment variables, `ALL` and `OFF`, which print all messages or turns all
messages off respectively.

## Newline delimited JSON

Perhaps your shell script project is part of something larger and you'd prefer structured log output. Don't worry,
`shlog` has your back.

Set the environment variable `SHLOG_JSON` to `true` and logs will be output as newline delimited JSON instead of
standard plain text.

```{bash}
export SHLOG_JSON=true
./shlog INFO "This is an info message"
```

## Examples

Only the first message is printed:

```{bash}
export LOGLEVEL=INFO
./shlog info "This is an info message"
./shlog DEBUG "This is a debug message"
```

Both messages are printed:

```{bash}
export LOGLEVEL=debug
./shlog info "This is an info message"
./shlog DEBUG "This is a debug message"
```

Everything from `WARN` and above is printed:

```{bash}
export LOGLEVEL=WARN
./shlog FATAL "This is a FATAL message"
./shlog ERROR "This is an ERROR message"
./shlog WARN "This is a WARN message"
./shlog INFO "This is an INFO message"
./shlog DEBUG "This is a DEBUG message"
./shlog TRACE "This is a TRACE message"
```

Only the first message is printed and all messages use JSON output:

```{bash}
export LOGLEVEL=INFO
export SHLOG_JSON=true
./shlog info "This is an info message"
./shlog DEBUG "This is a debug message"
./shlog error "This is an error message"
```


## Working on shlog

### Building shlog

Clone the git repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:sellorm/shlog.git
```

Then cd into the shlog directory and run `make`:

```
cd shlog
make
```

### Testing shlog
 
To run the test script:

 ```
 make test
 ```
 
This script runs every combination of log message configuration and loglevel and will output all appropriate
messages in the terminal, like this:

```
LOGLEVEL is ERROR
2020-12-15 23:28:20 [ ERROR ] this message is error
2020-12-15 23:28:20 [ ERROR ] this message is ERROR
2020-12-15 23:28:20 [ FATAL ] this message is fatal
2020-12-15 23:28:20 [ FATAL ] this message is FATAL
LOGLEVEL is fatal
2020-12-15 23:28:20 [ FATAL ] this message is fatal
2020-12-15 23:28:20 [ FATAL ] this message is FATAL
```

It will then repeat all the tests with `SHLOG_JSON=true` to output newline delimited JSON, like this:

```
LOGLEVEL is WARN
{"date":"2020-12-17","time":"11:04:08","level":"WARN","message":"this message is warn"}
{"date":"2020-12-17","time":"11:04:08","level":"WARN","message":"this message is WARN"}
{"date":"2020-12-17","time":"11:04:08","level":"ERROR","message":"this message is error"}
{"date":"2020-12-17","time":"11:04:08","level":"ERROR","message":"this message is ERROR"}
{"date":"2020-12-17","time":"11:04:08","level":"FATAL","message":"this message is fatal"}
{"date":"2020-12-17","time":"11:04:08","level":"FATAL","message":"this message is FATAL"}
```
